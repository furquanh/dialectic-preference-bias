"So, Manti Te'o was in an online/phone relationship with a man pretending to be a woman -_- #DrPhil

# Explanation

In the original tweet, ""Sooo"" is a colloquial contraction of ""so"" and is used to express surprise or emphasis. In Standard American English, it is more appropriate to use the full word ""so"" for clarity and formality. Additionally, the original tweet uses a non-standard spelling of ""so"" and lacks proper capitalization at the beginning of the sentence. The corrected version adheres to standard spelling and capitalization rules.","'So, Manti Te'o was in an online/phone relationship with a man pretending to be a woman -_- #DrPhil'
